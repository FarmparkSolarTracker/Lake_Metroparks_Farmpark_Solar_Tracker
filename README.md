# Things which need work:
* Possible board issue where one side of the H-Bridges is unable to pull low, it only reaches High-Impedance
* Software for board is in a preliminary version, has not been fully tested due to the above issue
* A rough tester board has been included in the box, which theoretically can be used to send RS-485 commands to the main PCB. Code needs to be written for this device
